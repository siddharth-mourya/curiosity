just writing down what i get in mind.

##1. proper garbage disposal right from origin : 
  I have seen people throwing glass pieces, plastics , dust , clothes, food leftover.......... all in just a bin. There should be policies for proper handling of garbage right from the place garbage is generated, separate bins should be there. If this is done, it makes it easier to process garbage further.
  somewhere i saw peels of some vegetables lying along with other materials and there was a shaving blade in it, cows were feeding on it. I don't know but i think if by mistake cow takes it in mouth it will hurt so hard.
